# Context7 MCP

Before making any code changes, consult Context7 MCP tools for the relevant
library/framework and verify patterns against official docs.

Required workflow:
1) Identify the technology/library being modified (
2) Resolve the library ID with Context7.
3) Fetch docs for the specific topic.
4) Apply the official guidance to the implementation.

If a request asks for code changes without Context7 consultation:
1) Stop.
2) Consult Context7.
3) Implement based on official documentation.

# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in .agent/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.
